Module 10

For the most part, most of my html/css thus far has been just getting it down, and looking presentable. I’ve had trouble getting things where I want them to be (since I still have trouble with objects overlapping, and then one going way off to the bottom of the page, or something like that. 
Currently, the biggest problem that I’m facing is how to get through my CSS in an organized manner, without having to put in a ton of different ID’s or classes (and it’s difficult). Now that I’m actually getting to the design of my pages, I don’t quite understand how to use one single CSS page for all of them—I, personally, feel like each page should have it’s own CSS page. It’s good, I suppose, to just have one. It keeps things clean an organized, and a separate page for each is just unnecessary, I’m sure. Doing this will also help me organize my CSS (I hope).
The one thing I can say at this moment, however, is that I like the CSS and design for my landing page. I believe that everything validates, and it looks good to me. I am getting better at diving things into sections. Another thing I am doing well with, in regards to the CSS, is the attributes, specifically the “a” attributes. That might not be something to be super proud of, but I have grasped, at the very least, how to make my links interesting and appealing to people visiting my site.  
From here on out, I am going to work on condensing my CSS down where I can, and using more Class tags instead of ID tags (what I’ve been doing is just giving each and every thing an ID tag, so I can work specifically with that section, which I’m sure get’s repetitive, especially when I’m doing similar CSS in different areas).
