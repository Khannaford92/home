Module 11

For the SCRUM workshops, it was very nice to get feedback from my group. We all had our 
own strengths and weaknesses with our portfolios, and I think the feedback each of us got 
was very helpful. For my portfolio, my main struggle was finalizing decisions I wanted to 
make, since I am an indecisive person. The members of my group pointed out the things they 
liked about my landing page and “about” page (those were the two main pages I had ready 
for the workshop), and they helped me through the layout of my pages—I did not follow my 
original wire-frames, as I discovered that I thought they looked good at first, but as I 
went to actually do the coding for it, I did not like the way it looked, so my final 
portfolio is actually quite different than my original design. 

For help with my portfolio, and where I would point my group members to if they asked for 
help, was W3Schools.com, among other websites. I found a lot of help just by googling 
certain things I wanted to do, such as “how to code [images, hover, etc.] in css”. 
W3Schools was a good source for me to use, and I am sure that I will continue to use it 
as I tweak and change my portfolio.

Overall, the SCRUM workshop was very helpful. We didn’t spend as much time giving 
feedback as we did simply working with code and helping each other where we needed it, 
but it was nice to work with a group in a more relaxed setting. One girl in my group I 
sit next to in class, and we talk in class most days, so we have been there to help each 
other throughout the semester, which has been nice also. It was good getting a fresh pair 
of eyes on my website, from people I don’t usually talk to, but it was also nice because 
I was already in my comfort zone, as I talk to Katheryn each class.
